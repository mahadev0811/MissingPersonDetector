# Missing Person Detection System with DeepFace and SQLite

This project implements a missing person detection system that leverages facial recognition and database interaction. It utilizes the capabilities of the DeepFace library for real-time face detection and recognition, and SQLite for managing missing person information.

## Features

### - Facial Recognition:
DeepFace library for face detection and recognition in video frames or live camera feed.
Command-line configurable facial recognition model (Dlib, VGG-Face, Facenet, etc.) and detector backend (ssd, mtcnn, retinaface, etc.) for optimized performance.

### - Database Management:
SQLite database stores missing person details (names, images, etc.).
Connects to the database for retrieving information during facial recognition.

### - Detection Logic:
Analyzes video frames (or live camera feed) to detect faces using DeepFace.
Compares identified faces against the missing person database for verification.
Configurable "surity level" dictates the number of detections within a timeframe (in seconds) to be considered a verified match.

### - Verification and Reporting:
Upon verified match:
Saves an image of the detected missing person.
Updates a scan_info.json file with details about the detection event (timestamps, image locations).

### - Error Handling and Logging:
Handles potential errors during database interaction, facial recognition, or video processing.
Logs errors to the scan_info.json file for troubleshooting.
